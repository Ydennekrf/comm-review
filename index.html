            <h2>Corsair RGB Scimitar Gaming Mouse</h2>
        <p><span style="margin-left: 25px;"></span>In the vast landscape of online gaming genres, Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games tends to have a very niche footprint.
             This has created a need for high quality specialized computer peripherals.
              Nothing says MMO mouse better than Corsair's RGB Scimitar line of gaming mice.
               With its 17 programable buttons, customizable button layout and overall quality it is no surprise why Corsair is the premier producer of computer peripherals. </p>

                        <p><span style="margin-left: 25px;"></span>As Esports has become increasingly popular, the focus on computer performance has follwed suit and Corsair has been leading the way. 
                            With a 12,000 DPI optical sensor from Pixart Technologies and a response time of only 1ms its hard to argue with the technology behind the high performance.
                             Story (2016) When you consider all this comes with a total weight of only 150 grams, your team mates and your wrist will thank you later . Lourenço et al. (2022) 
                             The only draw back being this mouse is wired, which explains the reduced weight and low response times. 
                             Sometimes this is the price to pay for in game performance. </p>

                        <p><span style="margin-left: 25px;"></span>Corsair built their brand on having unmatched quality control while using high-end materials for all their products, and the Scimitar gaming mouse is no different. The Scimitar while being on the cheaper end compared to its biggest competitors by no means feels "cheap". In your hand the mouse feels solid and ergonomically comfortable, which is important when raid night goes late into the night. </p>

                        <p>  <span style="margin-left: 35px;"></span>The scimitar gaming mouse is the perfect blend of visual and hardware customization.
                             With the ability to not only program all 17 buttons but adjust the placement of the 12 button thumb pad on the Scimitar, it brings something none of its rivals can.
                              Using a locking pin with a provided allen key there will be no worry about your buttons moving or slipping mid game.
                              <br>
                              <br> 
                              <span style="margin-left: 35px;"></span>If there was a negative to be mentioned, it would be the lack of detachable side rests like on other models such as the Dark Core Pro.
                                All this is to not mention the ability to save multiple profiles for button hotkeys and the RGB lighting. 
                                While having to use IQUE, Corsair's free software, can have a learning curve to get everything out of this hardware. 
                                Everything Corsair makes is pretty much plug and play to get you right into the action.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 25px;"></span>In closing, Corsair has once again found the balance between cost and custom, all without sacrificing the all important quality.
                         With 17 custom mapped buttons, a finely tuned optical sensor and lightweight design, you will be able to perform on raid night without having to break the bank while doing it. </p>
